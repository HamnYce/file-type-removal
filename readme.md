# File removal by type

### Simple script to recursively remove files of a specific type from a
### directory and all its sub-directories

Pre-requisites: Ruby

Usage:
  1. place script in the parent directory (files from this directory will be removed too)
  2. open terminal and run: 'ruby script.rb \<file types>'. e.g. ruby script.rb json (to remove all json files)

note: you can place multiple arguments seperated by a space to remove
multiple file types in one call
e.g: ruby script.rb json mp4 html
